WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.500
and so you both mentioned the fine

00:01.500 --> 00:03.000
tuning of the Universe um and so that

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
Discovery comes from science um and so

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
in your last interview with Richard

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Dawkins he said this was the nearest

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
approach to a good argument uh

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
so and so considering most people are

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
listening to this are novices to science

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
can you unpack what what fine tuning is

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
sure and it's a fairly recent

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
realization actually you know we do have

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
this remarkable set of equations that

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
govern the behavior of matter and energy

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
the gravity uh follows an invos Square

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
law that the speed of light is fixed um

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
that U all all the properties of the

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
atom follow certain abilities and rules

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
about how they stick together or fly

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
apart those laws beautiful as they are

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
have constants in them that I don't know

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
really anybody who will say we can

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
derive the value of those constants from

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
first principles

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
they're related to each other so maybe

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
there's some connection between them but

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
you can't figure out what they have to

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
be on the basis of theory you have to go

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
and measure that and so they have a

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
particular Val and maybe the easiest one

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
to explain is gravity because that's

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
certainly familiar to us in every death

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
so yeah there's that inverse Square law

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
and there's the gravitational constant

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
and that is of course important uh in

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
the beginning of the universe for the

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
way in which after a inflationary period

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
of everything flying apart they began to

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
actually coals and that's how we got

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
clouds of gas which then became

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
ultimately stars and planets and moons

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
and ultimately us here talking about it

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
so gravity is pretty important but if

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
you tweak the value of that

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
gravitational constant just a little bit

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
depending on who you ask and whose

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
calculation you did I mean a very little

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
bit maybe one part in a million what is

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
the one part in a million one like how

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
can you contextualize that okay if you

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
imagine the gravitational constant out

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
to seven decimal places and you change

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
that last decimal place that was an

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
eight into a seven and the rest is all

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
the same and then you go through the

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
math about what would happen if it was

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
just a little bit weaker there is it

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
quite enough there uh to get the

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
coalescence to happen and so you end up

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
with things just flying apart in a

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
pretty boring sterile way if you make it

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
just a little stronger then B come

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
together a little sooner but also the

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
expansion of the universe has a limit

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
and knowing that it takes billions of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
years before you get to the point where

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
something Al like complexity of chemistry can happen because of all the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
things that have to happen in Stars you never get to that point uh everything

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
would collapse back in a big crunch so

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
in order to have this possibility of something beautiful and interesting that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
had to have exactly that do and the strong and the weak nuclear force and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
multiple other constants all have to have that same property so you're talking

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
about the conditions needed for life to exist on Earth or for anything

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
interesting it's not just about this kind of life or this kind of Earth just

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
anything beyond some particles which hard to me imagine much Intelligence

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
coming out of particles flying apart by

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
themselves so anything that you would

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
call thought seems to require these

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
particular parameters to be set in a

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
very precise way and that seems to cry

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
out for an explanation and again as

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
somebody who also finds Beauty in the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
equations I find awe in the values of

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
those constants and they do call out to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
me for an

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
intelligence that is far beyond anything

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I could possibly imagine who I don't

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
think had to sit there and punch and get

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
just knew and thought and here it

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
was and I get it that the alternative is

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that there are an infinite number of

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
other parallel

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
universes and of course we have to be in

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the one where something interesting

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
could happen to have this conversation

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
but the inability to ever

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
measure except in the weirdest sort of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
way uh the possibility that those really

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
exist seems then to require a great leap

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
of faith uh to believe in the Multiverse

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
maybe for me greater than believing in a

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Creator who made it this way for our

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
universe so yeah I I think it seems a

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
little too easy to dismiss that and go

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
well it's the Multiverse think think

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
about that the other thing is that

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
doesn't solve the question of why

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
there's something instead of nothing

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
yeah sort of the big ultimate question

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and that also seems to require some kind

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
of an uncaused cause to have their

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Bea yeah so I mean in essence it was

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
fine tun I think I saw this online

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
somewhere but someone was saying like if

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
you took a pencil or something and you

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
like threw it across the universe at a

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
bullseye on like Pluto or something that

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
like the like and hitting it would be

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
like that would be the chances that life

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
would exist or something and so the

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
argument essentially is that with

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
fine-tuning life is just so incredibly

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
unlikely that like what is the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
explanation for that I've heard you talk

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
about this a little bit in um in your

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
podcast and interviews and I think you

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
said that this you find this going to be

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
pelling but doesn't really move you

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
really but so can you explain what your

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
of course it's compelling it's a great

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
mystery and it's an amazing finding

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
right that if we were to adapt these

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
values then nothing could exist there

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
are so many questions that spring up in

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
my mind there are just so many it's just

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
difficult to know where to begin I mean

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
we said for a moment ago you know God

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
doesn't punch in those numbers he just

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
kind of knows that that's how it has to

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
be he doesn't have to punch anything is

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
God is God constrained by these

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
constants he chooses to be he chooses to

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
be I don't know that in his existence

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
those constants exist he's not part he

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
created but he is not himself part of

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
the created universe so this is the

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
thing that that sort of confounds me is

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that before the universe exists and you

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
just have sort of God up in The Ether

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
he's sort of thinking about creating

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
this universe to put it crudely and for

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
some

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
reason God is confined to these very narrow

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
restraints and in fact could not create

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
a life permitting universe but within

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
those

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
constraints and those and and and

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
therefore before this universe is even

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
created God is in some way constrained

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
by the strong and nuclear forces I don't

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
understand that at all you're suggesting

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
that God is part of the creation that

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
God put in place for the universe God

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
doesn't have to be constrained that way

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
God is outside of space outside of time

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
yeah not not B basically having to

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
adhere to any of such I don't mean that

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
God is constrained by those forces that

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
they're like acting upon him I mean that

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
he's constrained in the sense that he

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
can only create a material world that

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
abides by those particular constraints

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
oh I think you create any material word

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I think he wanted to create one that was

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
interesting and so he made the selection

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
of those equations and those Constance

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
in order for it not to just be a big

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
waste of time but would it have been

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
impossible for him to create a universe

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that's life emitting and just as

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
interesting in which gravity was

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Stronger well I don't think it would

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
have been as

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
interesting God was interested you

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
thought but but I mean a thought for

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
missing Universe right so it's like a

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
universe where basically everything is

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
the same as a it is now let's say that

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
um that the gravity is stronger but this

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
dark energy that's causing the universe

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
to expand is a bit stronger or there's

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
some other introduced force or or in

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
other words when God goes to create the

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
universe is he constrained in the sense

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that if he wants to create this thought

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
permitting universe that everything has

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
to be so finally balanc in other words

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I'm not sure why the meta conditions are

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
set up so that everything is on on such

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
a knife edge maybe I can spell it out

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
like this right so

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
imagine I have a friend who um Phil

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Halper who made this documentary about

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
the the funi argument and there was a

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
really interesting response that made

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
reference to the Gnostic Christian

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
tradition the the Christian gnostics

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
believed in the the sort of the material

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
world being the product of an evil

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
demiurge it's like uh that this God of

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
the Old Testament is the is the evil

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
creator of the material world and Jesus

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
represents the true God who is you know

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
spiritually pure and above all and he

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
was like well doesn't the fine tuning

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
argument kind of fit in better with this

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
kind of picture of the universe why


00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
because the spiritual Creator who who

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
realizes that the material world is evil

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and terrible doesn't want the material

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
world to come about and so he makes it

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
so that it is near on impossible for a

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
material Universe like this to exist and

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
yet the evil demiurge wants to create

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
that universe and so he comes in and he

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
perfectly Tunes everything so although

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
it's completely improbable he just makes

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
it right that the material world can can

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
be created but I think that this kind of

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
slightly um contrived image can help to

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
demonstrate is that the very fact that

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
it is so difficult to bring

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
about the the material world but by

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
finally tuning these constraints is

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
itself sort of a a backfiring against

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
the existence of a Creator God who wants

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
there to be a universe like this and has

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
the power to do it in any way which he

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
pleases for example another analogy from

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the same documentary if if you were to

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
if you were to have like a a bag of of

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
of balls and you were pulling out

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
pulling out a ball and you were trying

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
to figure out what the favorite color of

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
the of the creator of the of the bag was

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and you reach in and you pull out a

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
purple ball that might be confirming

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
evidence that the creator of the game

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
likes the color purple but if you then

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
tipped out every other ball and looked

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
that every single other one except for

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
the one that you picked was yellow you

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
might actually think oh okay the the

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
creator of this game clearly prefers

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
yellow but I just happen to have picked

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
the blue one now obviously that analogy

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
doesn't work CU that revolves around

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
chance but the point specifically being

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
that if the conditions are set up so

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that there are an almost infinite number

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
of ways that things could have been

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
where none of this could have happened

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and only one very precise way that it

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
could have happened the person who sets

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
up that meta condition what are we to

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
make of of of their view of of the

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
universe you see what I'm saying
